# Dots & Boxes Game
Dots and Boxes is a game for two players (or more). Starting with an empty grid of dots,
players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent
dots. The player who completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box earns one point and takes another turn.

The goal of the game is to connect dots and take as much boxes as you can and mark them
with your color.
